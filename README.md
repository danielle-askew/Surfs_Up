# Surfs_Up
For this project we are assiting a college in sharing data with possible investor W.Avy. We are analyzing temperature trends to determine whether Oahu, Hi would be a susitainble year round place to open up a surf and ice cream shop. 

Resources:
* SQLite
* SQLAlchemy
* Python
* Pandas
* Flask

W.Avy shared a Hawaii weather sql database file for temperature analysis. This information allowed us to quickly build useful visable information. We have it broken down to June and December temps.

## Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June 




## Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
